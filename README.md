# Alien Squish

A simple web-based game built in React (and still a Work in Progress)

## About the Game

It's inspired by a game I once played (pre 2000) on an Apple Mac, involving a mouse, a cat and some cheese all on a tiny grid.

The idea here is that you push around the rocks, and kill all the aliens in each level by squishing them between two rocks.

Meanwhile the aliens are moving around, and if one of them gets you you lose a life.
